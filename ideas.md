# Ideas

## CV Web App
Wrap my cv tool in a streamlit app.
Bring things into context and let the user add/remove them as they want to.
Get the tool writing suggestions for gaps that need filling.
Improve the cover letter generation to not just spit back the same words.
Add some rating functionality, i.e., how well a CV matches the JD.
Add critic review.

# My website
## Rough Architecture
- Probably try have it be a static site overall
- NextJS

Get themeing working nicely.
Use all the proper new API things.
Keep it simple.

**Landing Page**
Rough intro for me, an about me paragraph & nav to various other areas.

**Data Visualisation**
Find something cool I can visualise on my site.
> scrape data from somewhere via a function app on a timer
> store the data in a cheap storage layer
> maybe a function app that aggregates the data over time?
> display it on the site

What could be kind of cool to include in here?

**Blog**
Actually get some blog entry in.
Also do some regular "me" blog things in there

Blog ideas:
- getting started in data science
- ai/llm tooling
- data visualisation
- ??? other small hacky things i work on?

**Misc**
Track climbing stuff!

## Data Visualization
Use d3.js.
Just get some cool graphs going.
